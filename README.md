# StateMachine

## JavaScript state machine that just works - Well tested and AMD compatible

It's pretty obvious that this class is an implementation of a [finite state machine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Finite-state_machine) written in JavaScript. The main difference between this one and the many others out there is that it is built on top of my [EventEmitter](https://github.com/Wolfy87/EventEmitter) class. EventEmitter a is ridiculously fast, small and well tested event library that runs on pretty much every browser and JavaScript platform. It is also ready to load via AMD.
